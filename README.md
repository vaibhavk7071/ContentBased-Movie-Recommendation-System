# ContentBased-Movie-Recommendation-System
Created for movie enthusiasts who want to watch movies with content similar to their favourite movies. Uses the TMDB and moviesLens(100k) datasets to generate top-rated movies (both general and genre-wise) and even the movies that are the most similar to the user's preferred movies.

## Features
Unlike other Movie Recommenders, this recommends the user movies using a list of Movie Names provided by the user to recommend similar movies on the basis of similar content and thus can be used in the backend of a website to recommend registered users movies after analysing their previously liked movies.
